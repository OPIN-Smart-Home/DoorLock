# For User
## Introduction
The OPIN Door Lock is a smart security solution designed to enhance the safety and convenience of your home or office. By integrating with the [OPIN Gateway](https://github.com/OPIN-Smart-Home/OPIN-JetsonNano-public), this device allows users to remotely monitor and unlock their door via the OPIN mobile app. The door lock features an automatic locking mechanism, which automatically locks the door when it is closed, ensuring security without requiring manual intervention. 

Unlike other smart locks, the OPIN Door Lock only provides remote unlocking functionality since the locking occurs automatically. There are no automation options available for the lock/unlock mechanism, offering a straightforward and reliable security solution. 

The OPIN Door Lock can be easily integrated into existing smart home systems, providing real-time status updates and seamless interaction with other smart devices such as security cameras and alarms. The device is designed for modern smart homes, offering essential security features that ensure peace of mind for users.

For developers, the OPIN Door Lock uses MQTT protocol for communication, allowing for easy integration within the OPIN system. The device supports flexible API integration for custom use cases, while also ensuring simple installation and setup.

## Features
1. **Remote Unlocking**  
   The door lock can be unlocked remotely via the OPIN mobile app, providing flexibility and convenience. This feature is ideal for granting access to family members, visitors, or service personnel when you are away from home.
2. **Auto-Lock Mechanism**  
   The lock automatically engages when the door is closed, ensuring that your home is always secure without needing manual intervention. There is no remote locking feature as the lock is designed to automatically secure the door.
3. **Real-Time Status Updates**  
   Receive instant notifications on the lock's status through the OPIN mobile app. Know immediately when the door is unlocked or locked, giving you peace of mind.
4. **Manual Override**  
   In case of emergency or loss of connectivity, the OPIN Door Lock can still be operated manually, ensuring youâ€™re never locked out of your home.
5. **Integration with OPIN Gateway**  
   Seamlessly integrates with the OPIN Gateway, allowing the OPIN Door Lock to be a part of your larger smart home ecosystem. While automation options are not available, users can still monitor the lock's status along with other smart home devices through the app.

## Components and Interface
The following components are used in the OPIN Door Lock. The numbers correspond to the labels in the [cover image](#opin-door-lock).

1. [**Electric Rim Door Lock**](https://www.yalehome.com/it/en/products/mechanical/locks-for-wooden-doors/electric-rim-lock/678-electric-rim-lock)  
   The physical lock mechanism that automatically locks when the door is closed. It can be unlocked via the OPIN mobile app or manually with a key.

# For Developer
This section provides guidelines for developers looking to contribute to the OPIN Smart Home system. It's recommended to pay attention on [For User](#for-user) section.
## Installation
### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your development environment:
- **Arduino IDE** for uploading the firmware to the ESP32.
- **ESP32 Board Package** for Arduino IDE. For Arduino IDE, you can install it by going to **File > Preferences > Additional Board Manager URLs** and adding `https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json`. Then, navigate to **Tools > Board > Board Manager** and search for "ESP32".
- **Required Libraries**:
  - **WiFi**: For WiFi connectivity.
  - [**PicoMQTT** by MichaÅ‚ LeÅ›niewski](<https://github.com/mlesniew/PicoMQTT>) version `0.3.8` : To enable the ESP32 to function as an MQTT broker/server.
  - [**WiFiManager** by tzapu](<https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager>) version `2.0.17`: For handling WiFi connections and configurations.

### Clone the Repository
To get started with the project, clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OPIN-Smart-Home/DoorLock.git
```

## MQTT Topics
The following MQTT topics are utilized for communication between the OPIN Door Lock and the OPIN gateway:
- **User to Device (u2d)**:  
  `opin/DoorLock_[device_id]/u2d`  
  This topic is utilized for commands from the user to the OPIN Door Lock. Its sole function is to unlock the door.
- **Acknowledgment (ack)**:  
  `opin/DoorLock_[device_id]/ack`  
  This topic is used for sending acknowledgment messages, which include the current state of the door, as the door automatically locks itself when closed.
- **Device SSID**:  
  `OPIN-DoorLock-[device_id]`  
  This SSID is employed for connecting the OPIN Door Lock to WiFi during the initial configuration process.
> **Note**: The gateway will not accept the same `device_id` for multiple OPIN Door Locks. Developers must ensure that each OPIN Door Lock has a unique `device_id` to avoid communication conflicts within the system.

## Limitations
While the OPIN Door Lock provides several advantages for smart home security, there are some limitations to consider:
1. **Single Functionality**:  
   The OPIN Door Lock is designed solely for unlocking the door, as the locking mechanism is automatic when the door is closed. This limits its functionality compared to other smart locks that may offer additional features like remote locking.
2. **Dependence on Wi-Fi Connectivity**:  
   The functionality of the OPIN Door Lock relies heavily on a stable Wi-Fi connection. In the event of network issues, users may experience difficulties in accessing the lock remotely.
3. **Power Dependency**:  
   The device requires a continuous power supply to function. Any power outages or interruptions may render the lock inoperable until power is restored.
4. **Compatibility Issues**:  
   The OPIN Door Lock may not be compatible with all existing door frames and locking mechanisms. Proper installation may require additional adjustments or modifications.

## Future Development
The OPIN Door Lock team is committed to enhancing the product's functionality and user experience. The following features and improvements are planned for future development:
1. **Remote Locking Feature**:  
   Future updates may include the ability to remotely lock the door, providing users with greater control over their home security.
2. **Integration with Smart Home Ecosystems**:  
   Expanding compatibility with other smart home devices and platforms (such as Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, or Apple HomeKit) will enable more seamless automation and control.
3. **Mobile Notifications**:  
   Implementing real-time notifications to inform users of the doorâ€™s status (locked/unlocked) will enhance security and user awareness.
4. **Advanced Analytics**:  
   Future versions may include analytics features, providing users with insights into their door usage patterns and notifications for unusual activity.
